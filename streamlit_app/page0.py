    This project aims to build an **optimal portfolio of stocks listed on the BRVM**, using a quantitative approach
    and subject to performance and diversification constraints.

    The main objectives are:
    - Maximize diversification
    - Ensure a target annual return
    - Minimize portfolio risk (volatility)
    - Reduce correlation between selected stocks
    - Limit the individual weight of each asset

    The project uses **Pandas, NumPy, Plotly** for data analysis and **cvxpy** to solve the constrained quadratic optimization problem.
